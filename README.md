![Analysis](images/bigmart.jpg "bigmart")

The data scientists at BigMart have collected sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities for the year 2013. Now each product has certain attributes that set it apart from other products. The same is the case with each store. The aim is to build a predictive model to find out the sales of each product at a particular store so that it would help the decision-makers at BigMart to find out the properties of any product or store, which play a key role in increasing the overall sales.
